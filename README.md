### Backend Integration Ready
The application is designed to seamlessly integrate with the backend `engine.py` when ready:

```python
# Current dummy data structure
DUMMY_RESULTS = {
    "student_id": "STU123",
    "subject_scores": {
        "Mathematics": 18,
        "English": 15,
        "Science": 20,
        "Logical Reasoning": 17,
        "General Knowledge": 16
    },
    "total_score": 86,
    "annotated_image": "dummy_overlay.png",
    "evaluation_time": "2024-01-15 14:30:25",
    "confidence_score": 94.5
}
```

## Build Plan & Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundations (You Are Here)
- Vision Lead (engine.py)
  - Implement `flatten_image()` using contour + perspective warp.
  - Stub bubble reader and scoring against JSON key.
  - Provide CLI to test locally.
- UI Lead (app.py)
  - Streamlit UI with tabs: Upload, Results, Review, Dashboard.
  - Dummy data support and Demo Mode.
- Data Lead
  - Deliver `maps/default_key.json` and collect test images.

Outcome: a working vision engine (CLI) and a beautiful UI (fake data ready).

### Phase 2: Integration
- Integration Lead
  - Import `engine.evaluate_omr()` in `app.py` and replace dummy data when Demo Mode is off.
- UI Lead
  - Polish UI to support real data (loading, error states).
- Data Lead
  - Act as Lead Tester; upload varied test sheets and report issues.

### Phase 3: Polish & Wow Factor
- Engine returns annotated overlay (red/green marks) as PNG bytes.
- UI displays overlay with zoom and legend, improved UX.
- Data Lead continues testing and documenting results.

### Phase 4: Finalization & Pitch Prep
- Code Freeze; no new features.
- Data Lead prepares slides; Integration Lead assists with technical pitch.

## Engine CLI Usage

Run the OMR engine locally from the command line:

```bash
python engine.py --input path/to/omr_image.jpg \
                 --key maps/default_key.json \
                 --out result.json \
                 --overlay overlay.png
```

Outputs:
- `result.json` with: `student_id`, `subject_scores`, `total_score`, `evaluation_time`, `confidence_score`.
- `overlay.png` annotated sheet preview (for demo it is simulated and deterministic).

## App Integration & Testing

- Demo Mode: Toggle on to load sample results without uploading.
- Real Evaluation: Upload a PNG/JPG/PDF and click Run Evaluation; UI will call `engine.evaluate_omr()`.
- Results Tab: Shows total score, subject cards, table, and export buttons.
- Review Tab: Shows engine overlay (or a deterministic placeholder) with zoom.
- Dashboard Tab: Shows aggregate stats and recent evaluations (demo data).

## Backend API (FastAPI)

A lightweight REST API is available for integrating with external systems.

### Run the API server

```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2) Start the server (hot reload)
uvicorn fastapi_app:app --reload
```

- Health check: `GET http://localhost:8000/health`
- Evaluate: `POST http://localhost:8000/evaluate`
  - Form fields (multipart):
    - `file`: PNG/JPG/JPEG/PDF upload
    - `key_set`: `A` or `B` (default `A`)

Example cURL:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "file=@path/to/sheet.pdf" \
  -F "key_set=A" \
  http://localhost:8000/evaluate
```
The response JSON includes an `overlay_png_base64` field containing a base64-encoded annotated PNG.

## Database (SQLite)

Evaluation results are persisted to a local SQLite database at `omr.db` in the project root using SQLAlchemy.

- Model: `db.Result`
- Helper: `db.save_result(...)`
- The Streamlit app writes to DB automatically for real evaluations (not in Demo Mode).

To inspect the DB, you can use any SQLite browser or run Python:
```python
import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect('omr.db')
print(con.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM results').fetchone())
```

## PDF Handling

PDF uploads are supported end-to-end:
- The UI (`app.py`) accepts PDFs.
- The engine (`engine.py`) auto-detects PDFs by header and renders the first page to an image using PyMuPDF before processing.
- Recommended: scan at 300 DPI+ for best results.
